How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Stating Area with its files is part of the working directory, but not itÂ´s total. Giving me more control about which files to maintain and which to ignore.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Collect changes to separate files in the staging area and then commit in one action with a suitable description

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A branch is a developement in a certain part of the main project that can stand beside it or may live for at least some time in parallel with themain project. It helps to deploy work to more programmers in parallel.
