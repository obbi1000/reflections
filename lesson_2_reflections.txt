How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Stating Area with its files is part of the working directory, but not itÂ´s total. Giving me more control about which files to maintain and which to ignore.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Collect changes to separate files in the staging area and then commit in one action with a suitable description
